- surge
  - [DONE] add dns entry on ovh to make mirrorball.ovh to point to the surge domain
  - [DONE] is https certificate working?
    - yes, for surge based domains (mirrorball.surge.sh)
    - no, for custom domains (mirrorball.ovh)
  - [DONE] understand if deploying to mirrorball.surge.sh will affect also mirrorball.ovh and viceversa
    - they are separated, surge is creating a dedicated space for every domain. But this is an anti-pattern: multiple domains should be managed through redirects. Tearing down mirrorball.ovh on surge.
- ovh
  - [DONE] valid https certificate for mirrorball.it and www.mirrorball.it
