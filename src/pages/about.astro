<h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>
<p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I
    built myself!
</p>
<p>
    This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!
</p>

<p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
<ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
    <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
    {
        identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
        <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
    }
</ul>
<p>My skills are:</p>
<ul>
    {
        skills.map((skill) =>
            <li>{skill}</li>)
    }
</ul>
